          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
              The purpose of this project was to understand the importance of teamwork is in a company/team environment, and
              understanding how to maximise everyone's strengths and weaknesses. By being able to do this team members are able
              to excel in an area they are comfortable and knowledgeable about. It also allowed us to understand our team members
              non-academic strengths. By understanding these aspects, we should be able to create a product/service by the end
              of the semester.
          </p>
          <p>
              After several team meetings and possible idea's for out Project we settled on the idea to offer a box filled with
              one month's worth of interior car cleaning supplies that can be bought for a one time purchase or a monthly
              subscription

          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <p>
              During this class we took several tests to determine the qualities that I can positively bring to a group environment.
              My top quality was 'Stragic Thinking'. THis suggests that I am a methodological person that needs structure and
              organization. This meant I was able to help set deadlines and provide goals each week for the team members to meet.
          </p>
          <p>
              One of the other skills I was able to bring to the table was my tech skills. I created the online survey and a web
              presence. The website was able to gather user information (name and email) for customers who where interested in the
              future release of the product.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
              We conducted research by sending online surveys to as many students as we could, trying to generate validation for our
              product. We also gathered quantitative data that would be could be resourceful to us from local car wash companies.
              Below are the results:
