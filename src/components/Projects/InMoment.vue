          <h3>Executive Summary Abstract</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding and investing in Customer Experience is key to maintaining a competitive advantage in today\'s retail market.  While digital
            retail is replete with observational data-gathering methods, brick and mortar stores rely on self-reported customer survey feedback to
            guide their customer experience strategy.  A significant body of research shows that self-reported data is insufficient for making reliable
            strategic business decisions.  GeoX WiFi tracking can allow customer experience professionals to gather observational data on customers
            journeys through the store.

          <h3>Stakeholders & Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            • The retail companies will be the users of the feedback method. Their feedback on the new method is essential to the success of the
            innovation. The retail companies care about the product because they need good data/information on how to help consumers get what they need
            to boost the company's’ sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            • InMoment is the client who is needing this innovative feedback method to then sell and provide to the retail companies. InMoment’s
            interest in the product is to generate revenue and help gather more meaningful data.</p>
          <p>
            • The non-purchasing customers are important because if the improved method of gathering data from non-purchasing customers doesn’t work it
            is difficult to innovate the customer experience. Non-purchasing customers have interest in this product because it will help them be heard
            by companies in what needs to be different for them to have an experience that converts them into purchasing customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            • As the team creating the innovative method of non-purchaser feedback, we are also important stakeholders as we are the hub for gathering
            data from the other stakeholders and using our findings to inform an innovative, app-based solution.

          <h3>Validation & Verification</h3>
          <p>
            We first introduced this initial concept of using WiFi tracking to our sponsor, Joel, as an observational feedback method. After a brief
            demo of how WiFi tracking can be used our sponsor became very interested. The amount of data that can be acquired from using simple
            timestamps in zones around a store and mapping a user's path throughout a store. They would be able to deduce mass amounts of relevant data
            for their clients. Below are some examples our sponsor said this data could be used for:
          </p>
          <p>
            • You can track if a customer walks in uses the bathroom and walks out, allowing us to remove situations like this, to create data based on
            real situations
          </p>
          <p>
            • They can deduce how long a customer stays in one zone.</p>
          <p>
            • Using timestamps for tracking how well a waiter is performing compared to survey data.
          <p>
            The presentation allowed our sponsors to start thinking about all the possibilities our design and project will offer to retail companies
            Our presentation really excited the sponsors and they are looking forward to the future progress of this project. Our sponsors want us to
            present to all their clients at the end of February at their CX conference.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            GeoX will provide a innovative method that InMoment can use to understand a larger portion of customers shopping in retail stores. The
            data obtainable through GeoX will provide insights InMoment can use to further improve customers’ experience. It is our Capstone Team’s
            goal to provide an early prototype of this new method that will enable InMoment to begin gathering this observational data. The details in
            this document will provide a structure for our team as well as help us maintain our vision and provide a solution to our problem statement.
